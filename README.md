## 7.3 React Chat App

This handy little chat app was our first time pairing React with Backbone to create a full MVC framework with those tools. This was definitely one of the more exciting projects up to this point because we hadn't yet fully learned about localstorage, but I was able to do some research and have a persisting username for when you chat. We also got a lot of practice pointing to a specific endpoint on a server and dealing with an API.
